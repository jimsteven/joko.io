1. Sir I used NotePad++ to edit the HTML so I didn't know which file to send, so I just sent you a copy of the code I use in NotePad++
2. I asked one of my ates at church to help me with this but I am the only one who touched the HTML.
3. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn HTML it has been an interesting experience and it was a really fun challeng. Thank you Sir Jim!
